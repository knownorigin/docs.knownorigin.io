# Making card payments

**You can now **buy art** and **top-up** your **ETH** balance directly from with your credit or debit card.**

We have partnered with a new payment provider [wert.io](https://wert.io/) which facilitates all card to cryptocurrency
transactions but with the added bonus to buy your favourite NFTs and CryptoArt directly in a single card purchase, the
tokens landing directly in your wallet.

## Buy with card

**You can now make a primary sale purchase directly with your traditional credit/debit card.**

1. Login to KO as normal

2. When visiting a listed artwork you will see a new `Buy with card` button

3. Once you are ready with your card in hard, `confirm` the transaction and start the purchase flow

4. Enter your card details and address details, completing any additional KYC/AML steps if requested.

5. Once the purchase has been triggered, you will be presented with a `pending` screen as the purchase occurs.

6. Once complete you will receive the NFT directly to your wallet 🤯 🔥

**If any problems arise, you will receive the purchased ETH directly to your wallet.**

7. Send your self an email receipt for you records.

We will be expanding this in the future to include secondary sales if this trial is well-received and works goes to
plan.

## Add funds from card

**Use this to top-up your Ethereum address directly from KO and using your credit/debit card.**

1. Login to your profile click `Add funds` to launch the top-up flow.
