# I can't see the image for my artwork on another marketplace 

This sometimes occurs because some marketplaces request timeout when trying to retrieve the image from IPFS. 
We have found that this can usually be resolved by refreshing the metadata of the artwork on these platforms 
and waiting 5-10 minutes before refreshing the page. Below is how this is done on Rarible though we are aware 
it can be done on other platforms as well.
