# What to do if you have been hacked

As a first step if you have any suspicion that your device's security may have been compromised move the contents of your wallet to a 
new safe wallet as soon as possible and cease using it. Once this has been done please contact one of the team, and we will be able to offer advice
on a case by case basis. Unfortunately, due to the nature of blockchain there are considerable limitations on the help that we 
are able to provide to those who have been hacked. Here is a few of the things we are and are not able to offer:

* WE CANNOT transfer any of the tokens minted from the hacked account to another one
* WE CANNOT divert any funds that have been sent to that account
* WE CAN help you create a new artist account
* WE CAN change the name of the compromised profile to indicate that this is a hacked/inactive account
* WE CAN stop the hacked account from being able to mint any new tokens

Of course, ideally this could all be avoided if your account isn't compromised in the first place which can be imple√ßmented fairly easily.
