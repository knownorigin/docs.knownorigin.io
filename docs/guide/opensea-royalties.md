#### The problem

`OpenSea` and potentially other NFT aggregators may not pay out royalties to creators when minted on platforms like
`KnownOrigin`, this is due to a technical limitation in the way they pay out fees, often restricting payments to a
single address, this clearly will not work when we have 4000+ creators.

Other problems exist such as non-atomic post sale settlement, custodial nature of handling funds and generally being a
suboptimal solution, something which really should be handled at the time of sale.

When items are bought and sold on `KnownOrigin` itself, we correctly adhere to our contracts rules and correctly payout
royalties to any artist or collective. This unfortunately cannot be guaranteed for all other platforms.

In response to this problem we have built two things:

1. **Support for [ERC-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981)** - when this is widely adopted **any**
   marketplace can easily pay out to the original creators. Read a blog we wrote on this
   subject [here](https://medium.com/knownorigin/eip-2981-simple-and-effective-royalty-standards-for-all-dbd0b761a0f0).
   We also support the `Rarible` royalties standard which should also mean royalties are payout to the creators.
   **This is the real solution is ERC-2981 in our opinion**

2. **Open-source non-custodial royalties capturing contract** - this allows `OpenSea` to send any royalties funds to a
   single address. We can then we can generate a set of merkle proofs based on the `OpenSea` API, in essence running an
   off-chain reconciliation process in a non-custodial, public and verifiable way. Although the KO team is running this
   process there is a clear path to decentralisation which is key to this solution.

#### How it works

Periodically `OpenSea` payout royalties, this is based on their own rules and is out of our control.

When a payout happens, we see the event and then run the reconciliation script, publish to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and
update the smart contract claim balances.

**This appears to happen ever 1-2 weeks based on accidental evidence**

Claimants can then check their profile and `claim` and funds which have accrued from OpenSea.

Claimants can also let royalties build up and then only `claim` when they have enough to justify any GAS costs.
