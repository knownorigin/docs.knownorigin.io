# Donating to Charity

A new feature of KnownOrigin is to empower users to directly support charities which align with our community and which
support donations in Ethereum. KnownOrigin does not take or handle any of the funds, we only provide the tools.

We plan on rotating these charities every 3-6 months, guided by the community. If you want to add/change or remove
any, please join [Discord](https://discord.gg/knownorigin) and let us know.
