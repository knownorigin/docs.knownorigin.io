# Join as an Artist

## How to apply?

Start off by making a profile on KO and filling in this [form](https://knownorigin.io/artist-application).  

The application window opens once the last batch has been processed, stay tuned to our socials to find out when the next window opens!

## What will I need to apply?

* A portfolio with no more than 5 works (please make sure you give permission for it to be seen by us if it is a google docs or dropbox).
* A brief summary of your work and why you think you'll be a good addition to KO.
* Meet all the requirements for application such as making sure your profile is fully complete with profile/cover images and social media links.

## How long does it take?

We endeavor to deal with all applications within a month of applying.

We appreciate your patience. Once you have been approved and verified, artists will be enabled in weekly batches.

## Can I re-apply?

Yes, we welcome this! Just review your profile, and your portfolio to make sure it is the best it can be.

## How does the process work?

In the spirit of being transparent, the following flow diagram is the process we use at a high level.

As an artist moves through this process, emails will be sent at each stage.

As this is a new flow and process we do expect some duplicates and issues so bear with us.
