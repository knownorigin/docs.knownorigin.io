# Setting a minimum-bid on your work

We allow you to set a minimum-bid on your work after minting. This means that collectors will only be able to place bids which equal or exceed the minimum you have set. This is all done off-chain so is free of charge.

This can be accessed from the three dots <strong>(...)</strong> button. This can be found in the bottom right of any artworks that you have minted within the artworks tab on your profile. Please note that this can only be done on unsold primary offers only editions and unlisted secondary offers only tokens.
