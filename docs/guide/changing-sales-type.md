# Changing listing type

You are able to change the listing type of your own listings on both primary and secondary. The option to do this can be accessed from the three dots (...) button. This can be found in the bottom right of any artworks that you have minted or collected within the artworks (primary) and collection (secondary) tab on your profile. When the three dots button is clicked this will show a list of actions you are able to perform on the token. If you select 'change listing' it will open a new window like the one below. Here you will simply need to select which sales type you wish to change to and the new price you wish to set.
