## What is Gwei (used to denominate gas price)?
Gwei is a denomination of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), which is used on the Ethereum network.

Gwei is the most commonly used unit of ether because "gas" prices are easily specified in gwei. For example, instead of saying that your gas costs 0.000000001 ether, you can say your gas costs 1 gwei.

## Why do I have to pay to mint?
The Ethereum network is constantly processing transactions based on demand, it naturally has spikes in usage at various times or driven by things happening in the ecosystem, therefore, the price of gas will rise and fall inline with this demand.
 
Note: As a consequence the cost of minting a piece of work will also increase if you attempt to mint in a period of intense usage. 

When you are minting a work you will be given a prediction of how much the mint will cost in dollars.

If you have been quoted an unusually high price for minting we recommend you hold off and keep checking a gas price checker like this one [GAS Now](https://www.gasnow.org/) till the price has normailsed.
