# Frequently asked questions

## What is Gwei (used to denominate gas price)?

Gwei is a denomination of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), which is used on the Ethereum network.

Gwei is the most commonly used unit of ether because "gas" prices are easily specified in gwei. For example, instead of
saying that your gas costs 0.000000001 ether, you can say your gas costs 1 gwei.

## Why do I have to pay to mint?

The Ethereum network is constantly processing transactions based on demand, it naturally has spikes in usage at various
times or driven by things happening in the ecosystem, therefore, the price of gas will rise and fall inline with this
demand.

Note: As a consequence the cost of minting a piece of work will also increase if you attempt to mint in a period of
intense usage.

When you are minting a work you will be given a prediction of how much the mint will cost in dollars.

If you have been quoted an unusually high price for minting we recommend you hold off and keep checking a gas price
checker like this one [GAS Now](https://www.gasnow.org/) till the price has normailsed.

## How do I price my work?

This is a very complex problem that artists across the board face. There are a number of factors however that typically
affect price:

* Uniqueness/Rarity
* Popularity/Reputation of artist
* Edition size
* Time spent on work

Though these are only a few of the factors that can guide the pricing of work in this space the ultimate decider is you
and what you would be happy to accept for it. Initially setting your work to offers only may be a valuable method of
price discovery. You might also want to look at how your peers who are selling on KO price their work keeping in mind
the criteria above.
