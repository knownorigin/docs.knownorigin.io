# Code of Conduct

## What is a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organisation
who is interacting with the KnownOrigin community and its platform. 

Primarily aimed at not being evil! [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct)

## The code!

KnownOrigin wants things to simple, we don't want complicated workflows and complicated relationships and expect everyone to be respectful to all. 

At the end of the day the name of the game is respect, be respectful to all and treat others as you would expect to be treated.  

As Google says "Don't be evil", if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up!
