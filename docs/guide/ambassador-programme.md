## KnownOrigin Ambassador Programme


### What is the Ambassador Programme?

The ambassador programme is an important first step in our plan to become a more community curated and empowered platform. We’ll essentially be putting power in the hands of our community members. As time advances, we feel it’s only right that the community chooses who gets onto KnownOrigin and who’s featured.

### How do I become an Ambassador?

Ambassadors are picked through an application process, followed by an interview process. We will periodically open applications for rotating and new roles.

### What does an Ambassador do?

Ambassadors have onboarding and curatorial privileges, so are able to choose people from their represented group to get onto the platform and also choose who is featured on our website.

### What are the different types of ambassadors?

Ambassadors either fall under a social or artistic-discipline umbrella.

The ambassadors are as follows:
