# How to send counter-offers

Log in to your KnownOrigin profile and visit your offers tab. If you have an open bid you can now send a counter offer via the new button on the ‘Offers’ page.

Once you have sent a counter offer the button will turn green. This indicates that a counter offer has been sent to the bidder.

The bidder will receive an email and will also be able to place a new bid, withdraw or simply sit tight.

Our new counter offers feature is our first foray into the world of direct, on-platform communications. We are keen to bridge the gap between collectors and creators and help build long lasting relationships for the community - this platform update aims to do just that.
