### What is IPFS?

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) stands for InterPlanetary File System. The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and
peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

The IPFS network enabled files to be uploaded and stored by a network of willing participants, in a network of
peer-to-peer nodes. It also has other additional, important, features such as content addressable data, also known as
IPFS hashes or CIDs (Content Identifiers). This means that the data uploaded produces a unique fingerprint based on the
data itself, enabling you to prove the data stored on IPFS marries up to the reference kept on-chain, along with
ensuring it cannot be changed for something else as the hash would also change.
